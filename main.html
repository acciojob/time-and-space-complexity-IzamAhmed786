	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. 
    It is a crucial aspect when analyzing algorithms to determine how efficient they are, especially with large datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> describes the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. 
    A common notation for this is O(n), which indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with input.
